# libft

This is my Standard C Library. It includes functions from `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `type.h`, `string.h` and my original functions.

It is implemented using only the basic system calls and `libc` functions such as:

- `open`
- `close`
- `read`
- `write`
- `malloc`
- `free`
- `exit`

No global variables are used.

## Note

`printf` is in a [different repository](https://github.com/eisukeesaki/ft_printf).
